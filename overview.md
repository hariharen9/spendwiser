The application is SpendWiser, a comprehensive personal finance management tool built with React and Firebase. It aims to help users gain
  crystal clarity over their finances by providing robust tracking, budgeting, and analytical features.

  Here's a breakdown of its core features:

  1. Financial Tracking & Management:
   * Transactions: Users can add, edit, and delete income and expense transactions. Transactions can be filtered by search term, type
     (income/expense), category, and date range, and sorted by amount or date.
   * Accounts: Manage various financial accounts, including bank accounts and credit cards. The application dynamically calculates account
     balances based on transactions.
   * Categories: Users can define and manage custom categories for their transactions, with options to add, edit, delete, and reorder them.
     Transactions can be automatically re-categorized when a category is edited or deleted.
   * Recurring Transactions: Set up recurring income or expenses (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) which the application automatically
     processes and adds as transactions.

  2. Budgeting & Goal Setting:
   * Category-Based Budgets: Create and manage budgets for specific spending categories.
   * Total Monthly Budget: Set an overall monthly spending limit and receive alerts when a significant portion of it is used.
   * Financial Goals: Define and track progress towards financial goals, with the ability to add funds to goals from accounts.

  3. Debt & Loan Management:
   * Loan Tracking: Add and manage various loans, likely including details like principal, interest, and payment schedules.
   * Loan Simulator: (Implied from the landing page, but not explicitly detailed in App.tsx's direct functionality, suggesting it might be a
     more advanced calculation within the Loans section).

  4. Data Management & Security:
   * Data Persistence: All user data (transactions, accounts, budgets, goals, loans, settings) is stored securely in Firebase Firestore.
   * Data Import/Export:
       * CSV Import: Import transactions from CSV files.
       * CSV Export: Export transaction data to a CSV file.
       * Data Backup/Restore: Backup all financial data to a JSON file and restore it from a previously saved backup.
   * Account Deletion: Users can permanently delete their account and all associated data, with a re-authentication step for security.
   * Mock Data: For new users, the application can load mock data to provide an immediate hands-on experience. This mock data can be cleared
     at any time.

  5. Customization & User Experience:
   * Theme Preference: Toggle between dark and light modes, with the preference saved for future sessions.
   * Currency Selection: Choose the preferred currency for financial tracking.
   * Font Selection: Customize the application's font.
   * Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes, offering a mobile-friendly experience with bottom navigation and a top bar, and a
     sidebar for desktop.
   * Animations: Utilizes framer-motion for smooth page transitions and interactive elements, enhancing the user experience.
   * Toast Notifications: Provides subtle pop-up messages for user feedback (success, warning, error).
   * Help System: A dedicated help modal provides context-specific assistance.

  6. Underlying Technologies:
